            <h1>Master's Journey</h1>

            <p>On this page, I am going to try to share my journey throughout my entire graduate studies. I will frequently try to update this page as much as I can, so that one can understand the experience that I went through.</p>

            <p>When I begin my Master's program in September, I will be taking the following courses:
                <ul>
                    <li>GS/MATH 6004 0.00 A (Fall 2024-2025): Mathematics Seminar</li>
                    <li>GS/MATH 6121 3.00 A (Fall 2024-2025): Applied Algebra</li>
                    <li>GS/MATH 6461 3.00 A (Fall 2024-2025): Functional Analysis I</li>
                    <li>GS/MATH 6122 3.00 M (Winter 2024-2025): Algebra II</li>
                    <li>GS/MATH 6280 3.00 M (Winter 2024-2025): Measure Theory</li>
                </ul>
                Furthermore, I will be working on my Master's Thesis during this time as well.
            </p>

            <h2>Tentative Plan For The Year</h2>

            <p>Of course, doing a thesis would require a lot of my time and effort, so it's really a test. But hopefully with the rough plan I made, I can stay on track.</p>
            
            <h3>Pre-Work (May 2024-August 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a supervisor who would I would like to work with for my thesis. See what available projects they have that can be used for my thesis project.</li>
                <li>Read up on any course-related material before starting any course work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fall Semester (September 2024-December 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coursework: Take two courses MATH 6121 (Applied Algebra) and MATH 6461 (Functional Analysis) which are good foundational knowledge required for my thesis. Will also have to do MATH 6004 (Mathematics Seminar) for this semester. Probably need to spend about 60% of my time working on these two courses, maybe a 30%-30% split, and remaining 40% go to working on thesis.</li>
                <li>Exploration: Begin exploring potential thesis topics by discussing with professors, reviewing literature, and attending workshops/seminars. Narrow down options based on feasibility, interest, and available resources.</li>
                <li>Thesis Preparation: Start preparing for thesis by outlining the structure, setting goals, and identifying key milestones. Begin collecting relevant literature and resources to support the research.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Winter Semester (January 2024-April 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coursework: Take the remaining two courses MATH 6122 (Algebra II) and MATH 6280 (Measure Theory), ensuring they align with the thesis topic or provide additional knowledge and skills relevant to the research. Probably need to spend about 40% of my time working on these courses, maybe a 20%-20% split, and the remaining 60% go to working on thesis.</li>
                <li>Thesis Proposal: Submit a formal thesis proposal outlining my research question, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. Seek feedback from my advisor and committee members to refine my proposal.</li>
                <li>Research: Dedicate significant time to conducting research for your thesis. This involves literature review, theoretical groundwork, experimentation (if applicable), and data analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summer Semester (May 2024-August 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Thesis Writing: Begin writing thesis chapters based on the research findings. Stick to a structured writing schedule to ensure steady progress and meet deadlines.</li>
                <li>Feedback and Revisions: Regularly communicate with your advisor and committee members to receive feedback on your drafts. Revise your thesis based on their suggestions and comments.</li>
                <li>Defense Preparation: Prepare for your thesis defence by rehearsing your presentation, addressing potential questions, and ensuring you have a thorough understanding of your research.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Throughout the Year</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Time Management: Maintain a balanced schedule allocating for coursework, research, writing, and personal commitments. Prioritize tasks based on their importance and deadlines.</li>
                <li>Networking: Attend conferences, seminars, and workshops related to your thesis topic to expand your knowledge, network with peers and experts, and gain insights into current research trends.</li>
                <li>Self-Care: Take care of your physical and mental well-being by practicing self-care activities, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and seeking support when needed.</li>
            </ul>
