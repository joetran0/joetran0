            <p>My name is Joe, and I am an incoming MA student in Mathematics and Statistics, in particular, specializing in Pure Mathematics. I am passionate about the theory behind mathematics and it has been a guiding force throughout my education. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics for Education, where I focused my skills in teaching while deepening my understanding of mathematical abstraction, primarily focusing on areas such as analysis, algebra, and topology. Maybe beyond the classroom, I'll often be scribbling and writing proofs all around or maybe engrossed in a good textbook in mathematics. To me, mathematics is not only a subject, but it is also a language that unlocks the doors to endless possibilities.</p>
