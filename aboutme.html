            <p>I'm Joe Tran, and I'm thrilled to embark on the next chapter of my academic journey as an incoming Master's student in Mathematics and Statistics, specializing in Pure Mathematics.</p>

            <p>My passion for numbers and patterns has been a guiding force throughout my education. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics for Education, where I honed my skills in teaching while deepening my understanding of mathematical concepts, primarily focusing on areas such as analysis, algebra, and topology.</p>

            <p>Beyond the classroom, you'll often find me lost in thought, scribbling proofs on napkins, or engrossed in a good math book. I believe that mathematics is not just a subjectâ€”it's a language that unlocks doors to endless possibilities.</p>
